          I was born in a small village in Madurai in my grandparent's home and was brought up in Chennai, a city in the South of India.
          I did my schooling in <a href="https://www.maharishividyamandirch.com">Maharishi Vidya Mandir SSS</a>, a school quite famous in the neighborhood for training kids in med and engineering schools.
          My undergraduate degree was from the <strong><a href="https://www.nitt.edu/">National Institute of Technology, Trichy</a></strong>. My BTech major was from <em> Electrical and Electronics Engineering</em> (EEE) and I
          hold a minor degree from the <em>Department of Computer Applications</em>. I spent my undergraduate years exploring various fields that interest me and was into robotics
          in my sophomore and junior years. You could hardly find me in my hostel room, I would be someone who used to be always outside the hostel for a few reasons - I
          do not like sitting in one place for long hours, and second, I get bored very easily.
          I could confidently say that I'm not a pathetic singer, cause most of the time, I would be with my earphones on vibing to some random Tamil/ English / Hindi Songs and
          managed to pull it off without a complaint from my hostel wingmates or my roommate ( I did take some music lessons during my school days). Apart from that, I like painting,
          and coloring - watercolor, pastel colors, colored pencils, pencil sketches, I love everything when it comes to colors.
          I was a part of several teams - tech clubs, fest clubs, and managerial clubs, etc (more on it in the POR section).
          My experiences and projects that I worked on helped me figure my interest in the field of Computer Science and I do not want to cease my education anytime soon.

   I would be joining <em><strong><a href="https://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a></strong></em> (ASU) as a grad student of Computer Science this Fall 2022.

  <h1> Experiences</h1>
  <h2> Internships</h2>
  <h2> Everlaw - Oakland, California June -2021 to Aug - 2021</h2>
  <p>
    Worked on Document Anonymization and Deanonymization Project - Our goal was to produce some tools/scripts in Python that can take a set of documents and/or database fields and
    <em>"mostly"</em> anonymize them. The long-term goal was to make it so that most bugs in the Everlaw codebase can still be reproduced on the modified documents. To accomplish this, we use regex patterns, where we
    propose breaking text into words and labelling each word with a color. Each color has its own rules for anonymization.
